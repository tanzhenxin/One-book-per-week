# The Long Goodbye

> 作者 - 雷蒙德·钱德勒（ Raymond Chandler ）

美国“硬汉派”侦探大师雷蒙德·钱德勒代表作品《漫长的告别》发表于1953年，是作者的第六部长篇，荣获爱伦·坡最佳小说奖，入选美国推理协会“史上百部最佳推理小说”。

与其说是侦探或是推理类型小说，这本书更像是纯文学小说类型多一点，因为看了三分之二才有开始有推理的部分，而且基本上很直白，不像其他推理小说那样来个峰回路转让你大吃一惊的结局。

书中塑造了菲利普·马洛这个人物形象，他重感情，坚持自己的原则，有时热情，有时无情，入世又愤世嫉俗，矛盾的人格协调统一在一个人的身上，非常鲜活。

懒得写评论了，抄几段写的精彩的段落吧。。

> We said goodbye. I watched the cab out of sight. I went back up the steps and into the bedroom and pulled the bed to pieces and remade it. There was a long dark hair on one of the pillows. There was a lump of lead at the pit of my stomach.
The French have a phrase for it. The bastards have a phrase for everything and they are always right.
To say goodbye is to die a little.

> You bought a lot of me, Terry. For a smile and a nod and a wave of the hand and a few quiet drinks in a quiet bar here and there. It was nice while it lasted. So long, amigo. I won't say goodbye. I said it to you when it meant something. I said it when it was sad and lonely and final.

> He should have died young in the snow of Norway, my lover that I gave to death. He came back a friend of gamblers, the husband of a rich whore, a spoiled and ruined man, and probably some kind of crook in his past life. Time makes everything mean and shabby and wrinkled.
The tragedy of life, Howard, is not that the beautiful things die young, but they grow old and mean.

> "Alcohol is like love," he said. "The first kiss is magic, the second is intimate, the third is routine. After that you take the girl's clothes off."

> The law isn't justice. It's a very imperfect mechanism. If you press exactly the right buttons and are also lucky, justice may show up in the answer. A mechanism is all the law ever intended to be.
